In this file, I have documentated my journey from creating this blockchain from scratch. 
This file mainly contains my notes, explaination of my code for my-own understanding

1. created a blockchain class and it has an empty list (one to store our blockchain, another to store transactions).
2. Block consists of timestamp, a list of transactions, proof and hash of the PREVIOUS block. 
3. Each block contains hash of previous block which makes this blockchain immutable.
4. new_transaction(): adds a transaction to the list, it returns the index of the block. Parameter: sender(str, address), recipient(str, address), amount(int)
5. new_block(): returns a dicitonary named block, parameters: proof(int) which comes from proof-of-work algorithm
6. PoW is how new blocks are created or mined on the blockchain. In bitcoin, the PoW algorithm is called HashBash.
